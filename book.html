               <h3>The friendly hire: Why soft skills are essential in the workplace</h3>
                   <img src="img/career.jpeg" width="370" height="200" alt="dance" title="dance"/> 
               <p>Humans are underrated, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had once stated. At a time when artificial intelligence is changing our lives, leading to debate on the threat it poses to humans in the workspace, this view may seem posed to offer solace. But he is not wrong; and people are reinventing themselves to stay relevant at work.</p>

<p>A 2017 PricewaterhouseCoopers report titled ‘Workforce of the future: the competing forces shaping 2030’ found 86% of human soft skills will always be in demand. It also reported that 74% of those approached were ready to learn a new skill or retrain to keep themselves employable. What exactly are soft skills? Professional networking giant LinkedIn defines these as “less tangible and harder to quantify, such as etiquette, getting along with others, listening and engaging in small talk”. Communication, problem-solving, creativity and emotional intelligence all fall into its ambit.</p>

<p>In 2008, Google launched the Project Oxygen study to determine what makes a great manager. Soft skills formed the seven top characteristics even in an environment where one expects technical skills to hold greater value. The multi-year research initiative has since grown into a comprehensive programme, but the latest list from 2018 holds similar insights. In more recent data, LinkedIn’s ‘2019 Global Talent Trends Report’ notes that “as automation and AI continue to reshape entire industries, companies and jobs, strong soft skills — the one thing that machines can’t replace — are becoming absolutely vital”. According to it, 92% of recruiters said soft skills matter as much or more than hard skills when they hire; 89% felt “bad hires” have poor soft skills.</p>

               <p>Does this mean acquiring soft skills is a make-or-break deal today?</p>

<h4>Talking your way in</h4>
<p>“The biggest challenge has been the phrase “soft” skill itself; it’s almost like the phrase ‘weaker sex’,” says Santhosh Babu, managing director of OD Alternatives, which aids leadership development for corporates. Babu prefers calling them “transferable skills” that help professionals move up. “A lot of mundane things that machines can do will go away, and what will be left is the emotional, humane part.”</p>

<p>Richa Singh, senior partner at Integral HR, a recruitment firm in Delhi , says she has “noticed that people who are able to communicate and put forth their own expectations land an offer before anybody else”. An employer with multinational clients is most likely to think twice about a candidate who has the requisite technical certifications but finds it difficult to get along with stakeholders from different cultures; someone “less qualified” may bag the job for possessing better soft skills. This is corroborated by Anand Kumar, founder of Patna’s Super 30 coaching institute: “There are many IIT first-rank holders who don’t achieve the same heights as those who hold lower ranks or graduate from other engineering institutes only because they lack soft skills,” he says.</p>

<p>For Mohammad Rafique, 33, a Delhi-based entrepreneur who has earlier worked as customer care support with vCustomer, Wipro and Microsoft, acquiring soft skills was not a personal struggle, but he noticed a “huge lack of it” when he started work. He has both received and imparted soft skills training, but says some organisations have a “limited curriculum, with more stress on phonetics than, say, empathy”. In customer support, it is important to keep in mind how the client is going to feel when he hangs up the phone call. Empathy with customers is the focus of the training Sidhaant Sharma, too, gives employees at Concentrix BPO in Gurgaon, Haryana.</p>

<p>The growing importance of soft skills has led to a proliferation of courses — at Massive Open Online Courses and Udemy, for instance — on honing them. </p></div>

               <h3>Creativity comes alive</h3>
                   <img src="img/creative.jpeg" width="370" height="200" alt="dance" title="dance"/> 
               <h4>Being an animator requires a combination of creative and technical prowess to keep pace in an ever-evolving environment</h4>

<p>I am a Department Technical Director Specialist at DreamWorks Animation. I have been with DreamWorks for seven years and have had the opportunity to work with talented artists and contribute on magical, inspiring stories like “Kung Fu Panda 3”, “Trolls”, “Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted”, “The Boss Baby”, and “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World”.</p>

<p>In an animated film, the role of a Technical Director (TD) is to design artistic workflows, develop tools, and integrate new technology into the pipeline. A TD provides critical support to a show’s artists and department heads.</p>

               <p>They are the key players who troubleshoot and solve challenging problems during shot work, which could be related to fur, particle effects, animation or rendering. In the latest project, “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World”, my work as a lighting specialist has been to integrate our new in-house renderer and image de-noising tools into the pipeline for the lighting department.</p>
               <p>I spent my initial years in the ‘Asset creation departments’ — modelling and surfacing. The modelling department is responsible for creating 3D geometric representation of an asset from a 2D drawing. The surfacing department’s role is to add textures, colour and detail to the 3D model of an asset. I created visual development lighting rigs to analyse the look of these assets — characters and their props in different lighting scenarios. I also developed tools for asset costing pipeline that provide the rendering cost and other critical metrics associated with the complexity of the digital assets.</p>
               <p>Creativity has no bounds, and technology is what enables this creativity to come to life. Learning never ends, in the field of animation, where technology is ever-evolving; this keeps our work challenging and exciting.</p>

<h4>Three key-pointers</h4>
<p>Build strong core skills: (i) Get some formal education in the field of computer science. It could be an engineering degree, a diploma or rigorous self-study that teaches you the fundamentals.</p>

<p>(ii) Master the technology behind the modern art of computer animation. Take courses relating to computer graphics at school or online. Do projects in third-party applications such as Maya, Houdini, Nuke, Katana, and so on. This is where you start to enhance your relevance by learning technology which enables creativity. You start spending your time not just thinking about writing code, but also about how it impacts the characters’ visual appearance.</p>

<p>(iii) Understanding lighting, colour, contrasts, shades, shadows and really anything that involves replicating reality. Computer skills are obviously important; having good art skills is always a plus.</p>

<p>Build a portfolio: Your demo reel will allow you to visually showcase your talent and passion. That is what you will use to prove what you’re capable of. Even if you don’t have industry experience, which you can utilise, use your personal projects or side-gigs. So, put some serious thought into creating a decent portfolio that highlights not only your projects, but your personality.</p>
           <p>Network and build new contacts: Expose yourself to as many networking opportunities as possible, and apply for internships, even if one isn’t required for your college coursework. Find a mentor. It is all about building relationships with people in this business. Make a special effort to keep yourself inspired.</p></div>
